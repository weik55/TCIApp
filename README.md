# README

This App was made by Wei Kong to learn Ruby on Rails and as part of an evaluative project.

It is a movie review app that lets users leave reviews and find movies.

Thanks for visiting it!


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running. However, it was an incredible pain to get this set up
on another server. People should not follow the steps I did to get this up and
running.

Below are some things that I will include once I figure more of that out.


* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
